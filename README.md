# detect-boost-system
This Repositery has a Server Boost Detection System which sends a Message in a Channel if someone Boosts your Discord Server!

I have Made 2 Versions for people to use! I have made Discord.js Version 12 AND Version 13, which will suit majority of people as no one uses V11 Now. 

Feel free to edit the embed around to make it look nice, but please leave my Credit in it, as I made the code myself, and I would encourage you to give me credits.

If you have any issues, feel free to contact me! Discord: Nickzz#8039

Here is an Example on what it can look like!
